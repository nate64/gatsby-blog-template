So, as you may know, I am new to web development.  I love this field and am excited to keep learning.  I follow a lot of developers on Twitter and I appreciate their experience and perspective.  One side effect of following these people is that I tend to lose focus when they start raving about the latest new technology or the latest neat feature in the platform of their choice.  My focus goes from ‘learn, re-learn and cement the basics’ to ‘ooh, that does sound cool’ and I research that new thing, taking time away from the basics.

There is nothing wrong with Shiny New Things of course.  But I need to slow down and remind myself to build a solid foundation on the basics.  The basics for me right now are JavaScript, Ruby and Ruby on Rails.  I will branch out at some later point, but for now I want to be sure I am learning and not just chasing the next cool thing. 

Now, off to build another To-Do list app…
