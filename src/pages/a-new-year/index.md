## About Me

Me?  I’m just a normal guy that wants to spend all my time learning this ancient art of ‘coding’.  

I’ve been married to the girl of my dreams for 5 years now and we have 2 very adorable and happy little boys.  My family is very important to me and is who I spend time with when I am not pushing to Github.

I’m also a Veteran - I spent 12 years in the Utah Army National Guard.  I first served as an Intelligence Analyst and was deployed to support OEF (Afghanistan) in 2003.  Later, I was able to earn a slot to attend the US Army flight school where I learned to fly the Apache Attack Helicopter.  Here’s a quick picture I snapped crossing the Mississippi on a long cross country flight:

## How did I get here?  

I had a wild idea to quit my stable, benefitted job and complete one of those web development bootcamps.  I graduated from DevPoint Labs’ program in October of this year.

Since graduation I have been pushing out resumes, pushing to Github and working with several great folks I met at boot camp to get CodeShoppe Studios off the ground.  


## Why this blog?

My plan is to use this space as a way to keep my skills sharp writing about basic concepts, as well as a way to write about new concepts and technologies that I am learning.  Writing as if I have an audience is a good way for me to learn and re-learn as needed.  I’m excited to have this space as my own.
